# CyberOasisProjectReborn
My main repositry containing all the functions, utilities, strategies that help me trading & investing on crypto markets.

This project allowed me to self-develop my Python skills. I've started with minimal programing knowledge, where now I'm able to create tools that have real use.

Most useful scripts are:
- GetFullHistoryDF().main in  CCXT.get_full_history.py
- strategies.market_performers.market_perfomers.py
- All scritps in strategies.manual_utility

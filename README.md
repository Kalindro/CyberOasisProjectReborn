# CyberOasisProjectReborn

My main repository containing all the functions, utilities, strategies that help me to trade & invest on crypto
markets.

This project allowed me to self-develop my Python skills. I've started with minimal programing knowledge, where now I'm
able to create tools that have real use.

Most useful scripts are:

- GetFullHistoryDF().main in CCXT.get_full_history.py
- strategies.market_performers.market_performers.py
- All scripts in strategies.manual_utility

The user required input are exchange API keys, .env file in API folder should have structure as the example (
env_template).
